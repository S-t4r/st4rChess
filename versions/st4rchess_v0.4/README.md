Added a Player class.

There are some bugs that needs to be fixed. viz.,
- x and y coordinates are vice versa.
- Player class needs some restructuring.
- maybe some designing? NO!

- ### what does version 0.5 bring?
	- Player class full definition.
	- Add Rook Logic to the game!!! HOW!?!!?!?@#?!
		- For instance you can check each square up and down and see if it contains a Piece instance, if not, then add that square to legal moves?! hmmm,

Can't focus for a few days, but it's already been a week!
# GET IT DONE.
